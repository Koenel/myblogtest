# Food: a lost and found guidance

>There are different kinds of food, varieties by region, geography, peoples and preferences.

Since I've left the UK permanently (for the moment), I have found that readjusting to food is as tricky as leaving it behind in the first place. Our habits change but food is an integral part of life. So here's a list of foods that I feel I have lost
## The lost ones
- decent black tea
- fresh milk in glass bottles, delivered to my front door (yes, I was part of the milkman area!)
- cheddar
- chutney
- fish and chips
- pies
- gravy
- parsnips
- biscuits
- beagles

## THe rediscovered ones
Some of the ones above I have found, but not super happy:
- Cheddar: it does exist, but scarsely and quality is not good
- Beagles: do exist, but just one single brand, overly marketed as American, including flag and all. And not particularly tasty either.
