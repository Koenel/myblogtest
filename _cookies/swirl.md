Viennese whirls are a British biscuit consisting of soft shortbread biscuits piped into a whirl shape, said to be inspired by Austrian pastries, though entirely unrelated.

The most common UK version was popularised by Mr Kipling, consisting of two biscuits sandwiched with buttercream and jam. In this sense they resemble the older Empire biscuit.

Other varieties can have a single layer with chocolate piping.

There can be many different ways to make the shape of them (like into straight lines) and many different ways to pipe them. They can even be dipped in chocolate or any other dipping.

Viennese whirls can also have different kinds of fillings piped or spread into them. They can even be made plain.
