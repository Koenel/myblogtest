Caramel shortbread, also known as caramel shortcake, caramel squares, caramel slice, millionaire's shortbread, and millionaire's slice, is a biscuit confectionery item composed of a rectangular or sometimes circular shortbread biscuit base topped with caramel and milk chocolate. Additional ingredients and occasional add-ins may be incorporated, such as ground almonds or semolina flour. It is prepared in stages, with the cake-like shortbread base baked first, followed by the caramel and chocolate.
